= Introduction =

OS X and Java have never been a good marriage. This page tries to help Apple users in getting their environment ok for OS X. 

= Details =

==OS X 10.6.7 ==

The ccid driver on this version is only compiled for running in 32 bit mode and not in both 64 and 32 bit mode as the pcsc daemon is. Hence that 64 bit browsers like Firefox 4 and Safari will give problems for the eid applet. 

=== Java 1.6.0_24-b07-334 ===

*Firefox 3.6*

eid authentication and identification of the applet should work out of the box as 3.6 is a 32 bit browser. 

*Firefox 4* and *Chrome 10* and *Safari 5*

Will not work for any operation as this is a 64 bit browser. This can be resolved with following "Java Preferences" settings:
  * Run applets: In their own process
  * Java SE6 32bit on top of 64bit in ordering

Using this setting should allow for all operations to work.

Note that their are some display issues, mainly on Firefox and Chrome where the progressbar of the applet is flickeing heavily, work is in progress on resolving this.
Also when using the sign operation, a dialog from the eid middleware will not disappear after the sign operation has finished. This does not cause any failure on that or future signing operations.
