= Introduction =

OS X and Java have never been a good marriage. This page tries to help Apple users in getting their environment ok for OS X. 

= Details =

==OS X 10.6.7 ==

The ccid driver on this version is only compiled for running in 32 bit mode and not in both 64 and 32 bit mode as the pcsc daemon is. Hence that 64 bit browsers like Firefox 4 and Safari will give problems for the eid applet. 

=== Java 1.6.0_24-b07-334 ===

*Firefox 3.6*

eid authentication and identification of the applet should work out of the box as 3.6 is a 32 bit browser. 

*Firefox 4* and *Chrome 10* and *Safari 5*

Will not work for any operation as this is a 64 bit browser. This can be resolved with following "Java Preferences" settings:
  * Run applets: In their own process
  * Java SE6 32bit on top of 64bit in ordering

Using this setting should allow for all operations to work.

*Known Issues*

Some display issues like progressbar flickering exist on non-webkit browsers (Firefox, Chrome ) at the moment.  This due to the latest Java update which is using the new Java Browser Plugin 2 which still has alot of bugs. WebKit browsers like Safari and Opera do not have these issues as they are using a custom java plugin, built by Apple.

When using the sign operation, a dialog from the eid middleware will not disappear after the sign operation has finished. This does not cause any failure on that or future signing operations.
